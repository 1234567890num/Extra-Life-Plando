You awaken in the dead of night from a horrifying nightmare. The dreaded Phantom you encountered in the distant past at Neverland appeared before you and cast a terrifying curse, not on you or your friends, but on the various worlds themselves. 

Dripping with sweat from the vivid nightmare, you journey forth to explore and save these worlds just in case this nightmare was a premonition of things to come...

*You better hurry. Time stops for no one, and as the minute hand reaches 6 or 12, a world shall fall to darkness forever.*

**This curse is more powerful than before. The worlds are now randomly at risk of falling into darkness. The curse also affects the strength of enemies over time**
